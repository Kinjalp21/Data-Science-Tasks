## ðŸ“Š DS-Task 01: Visualizing Population Distribution

###  Objective
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable such as age or gender in a population.

###  Description
Using the `worldpopulation` dataset, this task explores the distribution of population characteristics like age groups or gender demographics. The main goal is to create insightful and easy-to-understand visualizations using bar charts and histograms.

###  Dataset
[Kaggle - World Population Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset)

## ðŸ“Š DS-Task 02: Data Cleaning and EDA - Titanic Dataset

###  Objective
Perform comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends.

###  Description
This task involves cleaning missing or inconsistent data, visualizing distributions and correlations, and generating hypotheses. Key insights into survival rates across gender, age, class, and embarkation points are extracted and visualized.

###  Dataset

## ðŸŒ² DS-Task 03: Decision Tree Classifier - Bank Marketing

###  Objective
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral attributes.

###  Description
This task applies supervised machine learning using a decision tree algorithm on the Bank Marketing dataset. The model is trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.

###  Dataset
[UCI Repository - Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)

## ðŸ’¬ DS-Task 04: Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data

###  Objective
Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

###  Description
This task leverages natural language processing (NLP) to clean, analyze, and visualize sentiments from tweets or posts. Sentiment polarity and subjectivity are extracted and visualized using word clouds, sentiment distribution plots, and time-series graphs.

###  Dataset
[Twitter Sentiment](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis)
